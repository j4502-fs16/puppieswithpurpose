    <p> If you would like to get involved, there are a number of ways you can do so. The most basic level is that of the general volunteers, who would join a commitee of their choice. These volunteers can utilize their specific skills or strengths but have very limited responsibility for our dogs.

We’re a growing organization that needs help in a variety of areas. We welcome students and local residents to volunteer in various roles. Whether you’re interested in public relations, fundraising, arts and crafts, photography, blogging or playing training games with our puppies, you can help out. We require members to be involved and commit to at least 3 service hours per semester.</p>

  <div id="yellow">
  <p>Puppy Raisers must be able to keep an assistance puppy at their home, take him or her to class and conduct the majority of socialization activities. Being a puppy raiser requires a tremendous amount of time and energy. These volunteers must have been in the organization for some time, must attend almost every official meeting and must meet with TerriAnn Tucker-Warhover, a veterinarian and our program coordinator once a week so that we know our puppies are happy and healthy. All expenses are covered by the organization, but keep in mind that raising an assistance puppy is no small commitment.

Many people join our organization under the misconception that we’re going to hand them a puppy on day one, but that’s not quite how it works. Puppy raisers have to meet numerous requirements and be prepared for the large responsibility of caring for an assistance puppy. </p>

  <div id="yellow">
  <p>Puppy Sitters are responsible for taking care of puppies for a few hours at a time. They assist the Puppy Raisers by taking care of the puppies while the Raisers are in situations when they are absolutely unable to keep their puppy with them. Puppy sitters play a vital role by taking the puppies for a short period of time, usually a few hours, and keep them safe and entertained. Puppy sitters must attend meetings frequently and be very familiar with the "Service Dog in Training" manual, which outlines the dos and don’ts of taking care of assistance puppies. Puppy sitters also have the opportunity to become puppy raisers, who are the primary caretakers of the puppies. </p>

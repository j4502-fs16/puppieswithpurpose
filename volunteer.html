  <h1>Volunteer</h1>

  <h2>Join a Committee</h2>
  <p> If you would like to get involved, there are a number of ways you can do so. The most basic level is that of general volunteer, who helps in any way he or she can but has very limited responsibility for our dogs.

We’re a growing organization and need help in a variety of areas. We welcome students and local residents to volunteer in various roles. Whether you’re interested in public relations, fundraising, arts and crafts, photography, blogging or playing training games with our puppies, you can help out. We require members to be involved and commit to at least *3* hours of service per semester.</p>

  <article class="ac-medium">

      <p>By raising and socializing puppies to become assistance dogs
        and by helping to create a disability conscious community,
        students will provide aid to people with disabilities while
        learning the value of service to society.</p>

      <p>Puppies with Purpose is an organization in Columbia, Missouri,
         that allows University of Missouri students to raise puppies to
         become service dogs. We work in conjunction with our parent organization,
         Canine Helpers Allow More Possibilities (CHAMP) Assistance Dogs, Inc.
         After our student volunteers work to socialize puppies and prepare them
         for the rigorous process of becoming service dogs, CHAMP trains them to
         aid people with a variety of cognitive and physical disabilities (though
         Puppies with Purpose and CHAMP do not provide service dogs for those needing
         help with visual or hearing impairments, or seizure or diabetic alerts).</p>

         <p>One of our primary missions is to assist in alleviating the drastic shortage
         of service dogs throughout the country. Disabled persons who would benefit from
         a service dog must wait for what may be years to obtain one – additionally, service
         dogs may cost as much as $23,000. The beauty of sending our puppies to CHAMP is that
         the organization is one of the few that does not charge the clients for their service
         dogs. CHAMP will place service dogs with children with disabilities, and through an
         extensive process, works to find perfect matches for the animals they train.</p>

         <p>It is also the mission of Puppies with Purpose to help to create a disability
         conscious community through our educational programs. Through presentations
         and demonstrations we educate students and the public about service dog etiquette
         and the important jobs these dogs perform daily.</p>

    <p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>

    <p>Puppies with Purpose is a nonprofit organization in Columbia,
      Missouri, dedicated to preparing puppies to become service dogs.
      By raising and socializing puppies to become assistance dogs and by
      helping to create a disability conscious community, students provide aid
      to people with disabilities while learning the value of service to society. Read more...</p>


      <p><strong>What We Do</strong></p>

      <p>Service dogs, also called assistance dogs, can be life changing for a
        person with cognitive or physical disabilities that need extra help with
        everyday tasks. There is a drastic shortage of service dogs in the United States,
         with a waiting list of two years or more, and service dogs can cost up to $23,000.
         Puppies with Purpose is working to offset the shortage of service dogs by allowing
         Mizzou students to raise and socialize service dogs in training. We do not train the
        dogs ourselves; rather, the dogs are trained through a special program at a women’s
        prison in Vandalia, Missouri.</p>

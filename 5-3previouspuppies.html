  <p>Name: Daisy</P>
  <p>Birthday: July 8, 2013</P>
  <p>Darling Daisy is the first female to come to Puppies with Purpose. Born on July 8, 2013, she was kindly donated to us by Harvestime Kennel in Menasha, Wisconsin. We picked her up on August 26, 2013 and Ellen Hinze is ecstatic to be her puppy raiser!
  </P>
  <p>After further training, it became apparent that Daisy was much happier as a homebody rather than a service dog, which is okay! It is hoped that one day she will feel comfortable enough to be a therapy dog and comfort those in nursing homes and in the hospital.

    <p>One of two puppies we picked up from Peertree Acres Labradors in Jefferson City, Missouri, Scout was born on December 31, 2013. He came to us on February 18, 2014. Scout is being co-raised by Joy Heady, Megan Warhover, and Terri Warhover. He is no longer in our program, but he is still a service dog in training.

   <p>Birthday: July 2, 2014</p>
   <p>Sadie, a golden retriever, is the second female to join the Puppies with Purpose gang. She was born on July 2, 2014. We picked her up from Golden Rose Kennels in Norlina, NC on September 2, 2014. Ellie Morr and Catherine Zak couldn’t be happier co-raisers! She is no longer in our program, but she is still a service dog in training.

  <p>Name: Yankee</P>
  <p>Birthday: September 26</p>
  <p>Yankee was born on September 26, 2013 at Brooks Labradors in Lucas, Texas. We picked him up on November 26, 2013 and his puppy raiser was Allie Beydler.
  </P>
  <p>Because of his high drive to work (especially for his tennis ball), it was later decided that Yankee would be better suited as a search and rescue dog. He is showing excellent progress in this field. We wish him luck as he continues his training!

  <div class="puppiesintro">
  <p>Name: Hershey</P>
  <p>Birthday: December 30, 2013</p>
  <p>The second newborn to come to Puppies with Purpose is Hershey, a Chocolate Labrador from Neverest Labs in Fox Lake, Wisconsin. He was born on December 30, 2013. Hershey is a little spitfire who is always up for an outdoor adventure. He loves walks, chasing sticks, and swimming in the pond at the local dog park. His favorite color is purple and he’ll do most anything for a treat!
  </P>
  <p>After a few rounds of training through the prison program and much deliberation, it was decided that Hershey would be better suited to being a therapy dog. His puppy raiser, Brittany Wibbenmeyer, adopted him from CHAMP and is working with him to become a certified therapy dog. As a therapy dog, Hershey will be able to visit patients in hospitals, people in nursing homes, and children in schools to provide comfort and love.
